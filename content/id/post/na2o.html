        <p>Bottle glass is made using a combination of soda and lime as the fluxes (float and container glasses have about 13% na 2 o ). Na2o + h2o → 2naон. In alkaline and neutral solutions it is stable whereas, in acidic solutions, the silicate ions will react with hydrogen ions and form silicic.</p>

        <h3>Na2O + H2O → 2Naон.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>To find the total number of atoms in na2o (sodium oxide) we’ll add up the number of each type of atom. Na2o or sodium oxide is a base as it is a metal oxide, and can’t qualify. Molar mass of na2o = 61.97894 g/mol.</p>
